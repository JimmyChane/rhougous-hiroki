    <p class="story-plot">
      Plot: Rhougous is born in a Dragon village in Germany, in a distant future. Where laser guns,
      laser swords, spacecraft, and instantaneous transport ships are a thing. Even Photon-Powered
      Teleportation Devices. There's no need of a propeller plane or Jet Engine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rhougous is born by his mom being an Water dragon and Dad being an Earth Mountain/Sky Dragon.
      They live peacefully until Rhougous is grown up till the 110th years old.
    </p>

    <p>
      The government had been negotiating with the Elder dragon of the Dragon village of demolish
      the village of dragons, that are made of stones, with stone castles, wooden, stone houses and
      whatnot. To create a new era of Hybrid dragon village consists of Modern buildings, high rise
      skyscrapers and a transport, space craft depot. For number of times that Elder Dragon denied
      the request, the more desperate of the government is to claim the land.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day, the lead of the Land Authority division, with number of military forces and guards,
      came to the Village and request the deal once more. Elder Dragon, declined again, angering the
      government personnel. They started set fire to the village house, corps, livestock. Everything
      went chaotic and fiery. Rhougous's dad, as the lead of the village guards, get his personal
      laser spear and shield, with his full armor attire on, followed by the other guards that are
      his followers, started defend against the guards and military forces. Rhougous's dad, once a
      military of the government, knows the tech and weaponry of the military and the training that
      gone through him. That's why he had his own laser tech of weapons. While the others, use
      really sharp and mighty of a sword, shield, spear that made with the strongest steel that they
      can find.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rhougous's dad ordered his wife and his son, to escape from the village, while he and his
      other troops defend against the threat. Both of them, grab their important things in their
      house, before the fire caught their houses. They ran, the guards noticed the escape and
      started chasing both of the dragons. His mom, however, tripped on a rock, fell down and
      sprained her ankle. Her mom, yelled at Rhougous, at the same time, crying and feeling in
      despair, saying to run away and get out of here. Before the guards got her, she throw
      something at Rhougous. It's a beautiful necklace, with a hologram display of the picture,
      three of them, happily smiled at the camera. Rhougous is in tears, running away, far and far,
      until the sight of guards is nowhere to be seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      He came into a place, where it seems to be a helipad. In front of him, he noticed a transport
      spaceship, loading cargo into the cargo bay. He slowly sneaked into the cargo bay, without the
      notice of the cargo personnel. He have no other choice. He doesn't know where to go. He
      doesn't know where it will bring him. But he certainly have no choice. The cargo bay, slowly
      close its doors. And it gets darker, and darker. He started to cry, looking at the holographic
      picture of his parents with himself. He sobbed, and slowly, fell asleep.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cargo spaceship, had come to a stop. The cargo door, opens. He swooshed out, passing by
      the cargo personnel and sees light. He is blinded for awhile, until, he noticed that he's in
      an foreign place that he doesn't know. There's high rise building, different beings with
      different species walking around back and forth. Orcs, Humans, Canines, and many more he does
      not recognize. He's in panic, running through crowds and crowds, until he hit on someone. He
      seems to be a human, wearing an apron, with his seems to be, a blue robot partner. The robot
      is huge, bigger than the human slightly, and Rhougous is almost as tall as the human.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What's wrong, fellow dragon? Are you in a hurry? I didn't see your kind of dragon around here
      before." The guy with the apron asked. Rhougous speaks nothing, started to slowly break his
      tears. Then, "I am lost, I don't know where to go, I...." -Rhougous speaks, with his words
      biting in each sentence. "Why don't you follow me? We will find your parents or friends while
      you stay over my place?" Rhougous nodded, he follows the human with the big robot beside him
      to his home.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looks like his home is in a very traditional Japanese home. With bamboo flooring, Futon.
      Although, his house looks like a mix of modern and futuristic style of home, is it nothing
      that Rhougous seem before.
    </p>

    <p>
      "So, what's your name? My name is Riku Yuuto(凉空 佑和) But people call me Hammond here, or
      Hammond the Hammer!" The human says. With a bit of manly laughter at the end. "I
      am...R-Rhougous, I am from the German Dragon Village" Rhougous replied. With a bit of
      shivering of insecurity, and not to mention his shocking state. "Wow! You're far! I don't see
      Western dragons much over here, especially from Germany!" "Oh yeah, that robot over there,
      he's Castroid. I saved him from the junkyard." Castroid waves at Rhougous and started to speak
      in a very robotic voice "Hello, fellow Dragon Rhougous. I am Castroid. I am once a robot of
      the government that fight for the space war. But now, I am with Hammond, my savior of my
      demise." "So, what brings you here, Rhougous?" Hammond questions, while curious of him, and
      his looks. Probably he had not seem a western dragon himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slowly, and with tears, Rhougous explained about his situation. Hammond is in shocked about
      his incident. While Castroid, nodded and understand his sorrows and hardships.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Do not worry, Rhougous. You will get through this incident very soon. I believe you can."
      Castroid replied, with him stooding with a musclebound pose. "You can stay with us! I can take
      care of you! But in return, you need to help me on the blacksmith job as well as chores! Not
      to mention giving you a Japanese name as well. You might be wanted from the government with
      that name of yours." Hammond replied.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rhougous gives a sign of relief, and smiled. Even though he had hardships and the situation he
      gone through, he smiled. As if he shows joy of abundance even the tough of things.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Hmm, I'll name you Hiroki in the end! The first name can stay" He suggested. "Hiroki (弘樹)
      means, Abundance, Joy. I can see the joy in you even with the hardships you're going on!" He
      nodded, and also, similarly with Castroid, standing with a musclebound pose, showing his
      strong muscles. He's wearing t-shirt, short pants and his blacksmith apron. His arm, chest,
      legs muscles are easily seen. He also wears glasses too. He looked really buffed and handsome
      in any way.
